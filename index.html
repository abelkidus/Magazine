                      On December 12, 2016, on the UEFA's UCL round of 16 draw,
                      RUUD GULLIT made the draw that set the stage for a match
                      between Unai Emery's PSG and Luis Enrique's Barcelona, to
                      be played on February 14th and March 8th. After 2 months
                      of unbearable wait, it was matchday. Forty Thousand
                      Barcelona fans travelled to Paris to watch their team play
                      against the hosts Paris Saint-German. The stadium
                      Parc-des-Princes filled up 3 hours before the game even
                      started. The whole stadium was very excited. The match
                      started, both teams were playing an even game until the
                      15th minute. PSG got a freekick outside the Barca's
                      penality box. Ángel Di María was chosen to take the
                      freekick. The birthday boy didn't let his team down, he
                      scored a beautiful freekick. 25 minutes later, at the 40th
                      minute, Julian Draxler scored another goal which gave the
                      home team a 2 - nil lead before half time. The frustrated
                      Barcelona fans waited 15 minutes for the second half
                      hoping their team would bounce back. After the second half
                      started, Barcelona's attacking trio MSN(Messi, Neymar and
                      Suarez) tried repeatedly, but they weren't lucky enough to
                      score against the PSG goalkeeper. At the 55th minute,
                      Ángel Di María scored his 2nd goal of the match and PSG
                      were leading 3-0. Barcelona were in the muds. Just as they
                      thought it couldn't get any worse, Edinson Cavani scored
                      the final goal of the match and gave his team a 4-0
                      victory over the Spanish gaints. PSG players and fans
                      celebrated their huge victory all night. <br /><br />
                      3 weeks later, it was time for the 2nd leg. This time
                      Barcelona were playing in their home, Camp Nou. Hours
                      before the game, in an interview Barcelona's manager Luis
                      Enrique was asked how he was planning to comeback from a
                      4-0 defeat, he simply replied "If they can score 4, we can
                      score 6". This mad him sound delusional, but he was
                      hopeful and he had a plan. The game was about to start and
                      there were about a hundred thousand fans, Ninty thousand
                      of them were Barcelona fans. The 90K fans waving the red
                      and blue flag started cheering when their team entered the
                      stadium, the noise so loud that it would have been
                      unlikely to found a PSG player who wasn't nerveous. The
                      match started and it only took 3 minutes for Luis Suarez
                      to find the net, Barcelona scored an early goal and they
                      were hungry for more. Barcelona were playing a beautiful
                      game, but they couldn't convert their shots. In the 40th
                      minute, Paris SaintGermain's Layvin Kurzawa scored an own
                      goal in an attempt to block a shot by Andrés Iniesta.
                      Barcelona went to half time leading 2-0 in the match and
                      only needing 2 goals to make it 4-4 on aggregate. The
                      second half started and PSG were yet to make an attempt on
                      Barca's goal. In the 50th minute Neymar Jr. was fouled
                      inside PSG's box, and the referee gave a penality to
                      Barcelona, and Lionel Messi scored it with power. The game
                      became 4-3 on aggregate. Barca looked like they were
                      actually going to make it, they were one goal away from
                      forcing the game to extra-time. Then Edinson Cavani with
                      the first glimpse of goal he had, shocked the whole
                      stadium by scoring a goal in the 62nd minute. Because of
                      the away goal rule, Barca now needed an extra three goals
                      if they are going to beat PSG. It seemed like there was no
                      coming back from this, but the Blugranasstill didn't lose
                      their hope. They just quickly restarted the game and
                      marched to PSG's penality box, but couldn't score a goal.
                      Time was running out, remaining time went from 30 minutes
                      to 20 then 10, 5 and suddenly it was the 88th minute,
                      Neymar gets fouled outside PSG's box, Neymar takes the
                      freekick and scores a mesmerizing goal from athight angle.
                      Barcelona were 2 goals down to achieve the impossible. The
                      assistant referee showed additional time of 5 minutes,
                      time was ticking. Barcelona were at it again, Messi
                      crosses the ball and Suarez gets fouled inside PSG's box
                      for a penality. Neymar steps up again and scores Barca's
                      fifth goal in the 92nd minute. For the next 3 minutes, the
                      whole studium were up on their feet. Barca fans were
                      praying for another miracle to seal the deal. It's Neymar
                      again, he gets a freekick, this time it was a little bit
                      to the left of the center-circle, 20 seconds were left to
                      the match, Neymar crossed the ball but Adrian Rabiot
                      cleared it with a header. Neymar gets the ball again, he
                      chipped the ball over the PSG defense, Sergio Roberto out
                      of nowhere reaches with his left foot, and BOOM! The whole
                      stadium, the whole world, went wild. Barcelona did the
                      impossible with only seconds left on the watch. Luis
                      Enrique run to the pitch to celebrate with his team. The
                      players joined the fans with celebration. Everybody in the
                      stadium witnessed an unforgattable night and Neymar,the
                      man of the match, imprintedhis name into the hearts of
                      Barca fans. <br /><br />
                      <strong>La Remontada</strong>, it's Spanish for
                      "comeback". It was a word nobody knew about, but now
                      whenever a football fan hears that word, they instantly
                      think ofthis extraordinary night.

                      (college student with a mobalilty impairment) My
                      definition of success is achieving personal goals,whatever
                      they may be. Being successful means the achievement of
                      desired visions and planned goals. And success is when you
                      reach your aim or purpose. Those who are successful have
                      achieved or are currently working to achieve their
                      greatest desires in their life and career. Individuals
                      often have different understandings of what success means
                      to them. Many types of success in this world Example:-
                      Inner success, economic. success, family success,physical
                      success. SUCCESSFUL LIFE. BECAUSE OR SUCCESS IS MEASURED
                      BY OTHER,BUT A SATISFIED LIFE IS BUTTER THAN A OR
                      SATISFACTION IS MEASURED BY OUR OWN SOUL, MIND AND HEART.

                      Generally success is a failure ,tired ,one day you sad and

                      the second larg town in Dutch republic. He showed
                      brilliant talent from an early age. After he settled in
                      the capital, Amsterdam, in 1631 or 1632, he quickly became
                      the leading portraitist in the city, his career was
                      successful for another decade, but in the 1640s his
                      worldly fortunes declined as he began to work more to
                      please himself than his wealthy clients. At this time, he
                      had personal problems, too, not least the death of his
                      beloved wife saskia in 1642. in the 1650s he had
                      increasing financial troubles and narrowly escaped
                      bankruptcy,but he recovered with the help of his mistress,
                      Hendrickje,and his son, Titus .The premature death marred
                      his final years, but the quality of his work remained
                      undimmed. In addition to the portrait that were his
                      mainstays,Rembrandt excelled in religious subjects and
                      made occasional but memorable contributions in other
                      fields, including landscapeand still life. He was also a
                      superb and prolific draftsman and by common consent the
                      greatest of all etchers. Self portrait <br /><br />
                      He battered by life's blows, but still proud and defiant,
                      Rembrandt gazes out of an image of noble authority. He
                      painted himself many times, but this is perhaps the most
                      imposing of all himself portraits. Earlier in his career,
                      he had often portrayed himself flamboyantly, playing out
                      some role in fancy costumes or showing off his success in
                      expensive clothes. Now, however, nearing 60, he is content
                      to Express the dignity of his profession. The picture
                      feeling of monumental strength stems partly from the
                      breadth of his brush work. Indeed, the handling is so
                      sketchy virtually everywhere except the head that many
                      experts think the painting is unfinished <br /><br />
                      He was an artist of great diversity, so it is likely that
                      he had not one but several reasons for portraying himself.
                      In his youth he provided a convenient and free model for
                      trying out facial expressions, for example, and later he
                      was probably inclined at times to celebrate his success
                      and social status. It is also likely that his self
                      portraits found ready market for even in his financially
                      strained later years he remained an admired figure. very
